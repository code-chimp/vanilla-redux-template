# Vanilla Redux Template

A React + Redux project spun up from [Create React App][cra] with all of my favorite pre-flight tooling wired up and
ready to go.

Features:

- [Redux / Redux Toolkit][rkt]
- [Bootstrap 5][bst]
- [Fontawesome 6][fa6] Free (easily upgradable)
- Draconian style and code quality enforcement courtesy of [Prettier][pret], [ESLint][esl], [StyleLint][sty] and
  [Jest][jst] powered by [Husky][hus] pre-commit hooks
- [Documentation!](docs/README.md)

## NOTE:

Feel free to use this as a basis for your own project but you may want to run `npx npm-check-updates` to ensure you are
getting the latest packages as I will only sporadically update `package.json` as I see major breaking changes or get
security warnings.
